Clank Jump Div is an AngularJS 1.x module to create an element called &lt;clank-jump-div&gt;. The jump div binds to an element and will swap positions with the element, in the DOM, when the defined breakpoint is triggered.

## How to use

### Placement
Place the jump div element and the jumping element in the DOM where you would like them to be when in mobile mode. 

### The Jump Div element
The jump div must have a unique ID.
```html
<clank-jump-div id="jump_test">
```
Next you will need to define the breakpoint at which the jump div will be triggered. This is done with the "jump-width" and "jump-height" attributes. Whenever the screen height and width is larger than the given values the jump div and element will swap positions in the DOM.
```html
<clank-jump-div id="jump_test" jump-width="768" jump-height="600">
```

### Bind the jumping element
To bind an element to the &lt;clank-jump-div&gt; apply the jump-to-div="ID" attribute to the element and replace the ID with the &lt;clank-jump-div id="jump_1"&gt; id attribute.
```html
<button jump-to-div="jump_test">TEST</button> 
```
